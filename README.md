Analyzing customer behavior for loan prediction: a comprehensive study

This research delves into analyzing the "Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior.csv" dataset available on Kaggle: [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/loan-prediction-based-on-customer-behavior).
The objective of this project is primarily for training and educational purposes. It aims to provide insights into refining consumer loan offerings by utilizing past customer behavior records to proactively identify likely defaulters among prospective clients, thereby segregating those with increased risk. Machine learning models are employed to forecast loan outcomes based on historical data.
Real-world applications may involve additional considerations and data sources. Use this project as a foundation for understanding the concepts and techniques involved in loan prediction, and consult with domain experts when implementing similar solutions in practical scenarios.
